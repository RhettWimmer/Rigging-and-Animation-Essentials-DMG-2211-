Local space:
When parenting something,
the child's local space will change
to it's parents


X is pointing down joint chain. 
Z Pointing up. it's the pin it rotates on

Orient joint tool

zero out all joint oreient in
attribute editor to make
tip joint match it's parent


Always zero out joints


cheat- freeze transformation options.
Freeze just rotations


everything should be 0, but X will have something In channel box
Attribute box all 0

_________

Constraints
	Parent -> Translate/Rotate

Constraints have PRIORITY over hierarchy

Maintain offset to keep them in their areas


Orient constrain: child rotates on it's own axis

Parentgroup (orientation/contraints-heiarchy)
|
-Controls -> Joints -> Geometry


group, control> group, control

IK 2-28-2019

Add prefered angle on elbow, use 5. Do this when creating the IK handle, or else it wont work
Only have one value in joint oirent for elbow

Create IK handle, click root then tip

Add nurb, put IK handle in the nurb to control the root


_________
IK 3/5/2019

- Create Joints
- Orient Joints (Elbow should only have one value) (Elbow: Value in Z only. 0 in X and Y)
- Prefered Angle
- IK Handle
- Pole Vector (Direction of "Elbow")
- Controls / Groups
	- Position/ Orientation


Match translations to set constrains

GRP
|_BaseCtrl
	|_MasterIK
		|_IKCtr

_____
IK 3/14

orient constraint for wrist to rotate hand

Modify > Convert > Nurbs to polygons

Root JNT
	|_ Spine JNT
	|_ Hip JNT

Parent constraint spine to base ctrl

Behavior flip for human

-Create joints
-Orient Joints
-Mirror joint


IK/FK
_______
Children with two parents share movememnt 50/50


Parent cotnrain options, turn off maintain offset


can middle click drag things into node editor
1 2 and 3 control size of node
Hypershade


Reverse:
	1 - input = output

Add Attribute on a control
hit tab in node editor and type reverse


1 - follow cube

	cube w > 1
	shpere w > 0

0 - follow Sphere

	cube w > 0
	Shpere w > 1


How to do this
	Make FK
	Make IK
	Make RK 
Parent all under the RK Joints

	Note: Contrains have priority over heirachy
	So Elbow wont follow shoulder
Control called IKFK_Switch
	Make it a float with min = 0, max= 1
Label switch IKFK match with 0 and 1 (Not necesary)

IK = 0, FK 0 (Not nesscary, but makes it easier to remember)

On the Joints
	Control into node editor
	Take a constraint
	take switch noodle to FK weight W0
	add reverse
	To input X to output X to W1
